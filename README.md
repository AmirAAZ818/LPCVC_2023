  <h1><strong>LPCVC, On-device Disaster Scene Parsing Competition</strong></h1>
  <p>During the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of interning at IPM (Institute For Research In Fundamental Sciences). My main focus was on a computer vision task called semantic segmentation. Even though I didn't achieve the highest score in the LPCVC 2023 competition, I gained a lot of intuition and knowledge from the experience. This repository contains some of the notebooks and code from this project, showcasing my dedication to learning and collaborating effectively with others.</p>
  <p>I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the LPCVC (Low Power Computer Vision Challenge) competition, which focused on this very task. The goal was to perform semantic segmentation on 512 x 512 images captured from a sky-earth perspective by a UAV, all in real-time using the Jetson Nano 2GB embedded on board.</p>
  <p>Through this competition, I gained invaluable insights into real-world applications of computer vision. This notebook serves as a documentation of my journey, outlining the steps, code, and insights gathered along the way.</p>
