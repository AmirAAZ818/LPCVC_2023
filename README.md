  <h1><strong>LPCVC, On-device Disaster Scene Parsing Competition</strong></h1>
  <p>I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the LPCVC (Low Power Computer Vision Challenge) competition, which focused on this very task. The goal was to perform semantic segmentation on 512 x 512 images captured from a sky-earth perspective by a UAV, all in real-time using the Jetson Nano 2GB embedded on board.</p>
  <p>Through this competition, I gained invaluable insights into real-world applications of computer vision. This notebook serves as a documentation of my journey, outlining the steps, code, and insights gathered along the way.</p>
